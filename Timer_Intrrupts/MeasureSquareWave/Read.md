Generate square wave on 50Hz using digital out. 
On breadboard connect output to analog input, with a condensator between, which should "round" the square.
Measure for a few seconds. Dump output on serial.

Modified code from https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Timer-Interrupts/ for interrupt samples
